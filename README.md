# NiceGui Authentication with PFX Certificate
Just a sample how to authenticate at a NiceGui application using a username, password and PFX file.

Start the app with `python3 app.py` and register yourself to get a PFX file. The PFX file is then used for the login.

Data is only saved temporary. If you kill the app, all data is lost.
